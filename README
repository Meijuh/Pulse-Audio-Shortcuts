Adds Pulse audio shortcuts to the Volume Menu. 

By default this(V2) now shows ALL options, and you must edit the extension.js to change what is shown, the options can be changed at the top around line 12. 

This requires the apps to already be installed, and does not install them for you. To verify they are installed open a terminal and try to run any of the following:
pavucontrol
paprefs
pavumeter
pulseaudio-equalizer
paman

The shortcuts are now displayed above Sound Settings instead of below, and when used with the MediaIntegration extension they will show above it as well, after a shell restart(alt f2, r)

~1 click install from E.G.O: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/109/pulse-audio-shortcuts/
